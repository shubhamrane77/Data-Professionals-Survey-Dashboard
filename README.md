# Data-Professionals-Survey-Dashboard
Data Professionals Survey Dashboard created with Power BI, visualizing the breakdown of survey responses from data professionals. The dashboard provides insights into job roles, salaries, favorite programming languages, and overall job satisfaction.

## Project Overview
This project is a **Data Professionals Survey Breakdown Dashboard** created using **Power BI**. It provides a comprehensive visual summary of the results from a survey conducted among data professionals, showcasing insights into key factors like job roles, salary ranges, programming languages, and work-life balance.

## Features
- **Country of Survey Takers**: Visualized in a tree map to show the geographical distribution of survey participants.
- **Average Salary by Job Title**: A bar chart that breaks down average salary across different job roles like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst.
- **Favorite Programming Language**: A stacked bar chart that shows the most popular programming languages among survey respondents, such as Python, R, and JavaScript.
- **Difficulty to Break Into Data**: A donut chart visualizes the respondentsâ€™ perception of how difficult it was to enter the data field, ranging from "Very Easy" to "Very Difficult."
- **Job Satisfaction**: Gauges are used to display average scores for happiness with work-life balance and salary, rated on a scale of 0-10.

## Dashboard Visualizations
The dashboard includes:
1. **Country of Survey Takers**: Displays the distribution of respondents from various countries, highlighting top contributors like the United States, India, and the United Kingdom.
2. **Average Salary by Job Title**: Shows how salaries vary across different roles in the data industry, with Data Scientists leading the pay scale.
3. **Favorite Programming Language**: Visualizes the most preferred programming languages among survey takers, with Python being the clear favorite.
4. **Difficulty to Break into Data**: Displays survey respondents' experience when breaking into the data industry.
5. **Job Satisfaction Gauges**: Two gauges illustrate survey respondents' satisfaction with their work-life balance (5.74/10) and salary (4.27/10).

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Survey Data**: Cleaned and processed using Power Query.
  
## How to Use
1. Download the Power BI file from the repository.
2. Open the file using Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore various insights by interacting with the visualizations.
4. Use slicers to filter and analyze specific segments of the data.

## Insights
- Python dominates as the favorite programming language across all job roles.
- Data Scientists have the highest average salary compared to other job titles.
- The majority of respondents find it neither easy nor difficult to break into the data industry.
- There is a noticeable gap in happiness between work-life balance and salary, with salary satisfaction being notably lower.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more granular filters for deeper demographic analysis.
- Add predictive insights to forecast job satisfaction based on current trends.
- Incorporate external datasets for more comparative analysis across regions.
